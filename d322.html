    <h1>D322—Introduction to IT</h1>
    <h2>Section 2:  Introduction to IT </h2>
    <h3>Define information technology (IT). </h3>
    <p>Information technology is the technology used to create, maintain, and make information available. IT manages and supports the technologies needed to develop, maintain, and use computer hardware and software, along with network connectivity and performance. Further, IT is responsible for the storage, processing, and distribution of information.</p>
    <h3>Explain the purpose of an IT department in an organization. </h3>
    <p>IT provides support to users by first analyzing the needs and issues, then identifying and implementing solutions so users can stay productive with minimal technical interruption. IT professionals must provide various levels of support to enable employees to complete their tasks. Users may need to access different organizational resources, have new hardware systems installed, or print a document on a printer that has stopped working.</p>
    <h3>Identify major IT roles and functions. </h3>
    <p>Administration focuses on system maintenance and user support. Architect focuses on system design and implementation planning. Engineering focuses on development. IT Roles: Analysts focuses on troubleshooting, data reporting, and consulting. Other IT Roles project manager, web dev (sounds like back-end work to me), QC, and sales </p>
    <h3>Five of the most commonly recognized computing disciplines.</h3>
    <p>Computer engineering (CE) (hardware and the software that makes it work) focuses on the design of hardware systems and the software that makes them work. In addition to writing drivers for peripheral devices, such as keyboards and printers, computer engineering addresses the development of solutions that use computers embedded in other devices like alarm systems, refrigerators, and self-driving cars. Computer science (CS) (solve complex problems through the use of computers) addresses the design and implementation of software with an emphasis on developing effective ways to solve computing problems and creating new ways to use computers. It encompasses a range of computing-related tasks such as robotics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and algorithms designed to solve problems. Software engineering (SE) (build software to solve business needs) focuses on the development and maintenance of reliable and efficient software systems to meet business requirements and support business-critical activities. The focus of information systems (IS) (network/storage system implementation) is to integrate IT solutions meant to meet organizational business goals. This computing discipline addresses systems that generate, process, and distribute information and support organizational communication and collaboration, their design, and their implementation. Information technology (IT) (keeps a system up to date) focuses more on the technology supporting information systems in an organization rather than the information residing on the systems or being communicated with them. In this sense, IT responds to the practical needs of the organization, including reliable and secure solutions that are appropriately maintained, updated, and replaced. </p>
    <h3>Explain the importance of ensuring that data and information systems support business goals and processes. </h3>
    <p>Data is valuable to organizations. Businesses that have used data to improve their marketing have realized the importance of data in increasing effectiveness and making better business decisions.</p>
    <h3>Differentiate between information and data. </h3>
    <p>Data includes raw facts or observations. Data includes raw facts or observations and, given context, becomes information. Information is a collection of processed data from a variety of sources. Information can be structured (form data) or unstructured (media files), and the key term associated with it is meaning. </p>
    <h3>Define information system. </h3>
    <p>Information systems are collections of data and information used to support decision-making in organizations.</p>
    <h3>Describe characteristics of valuable data. </h3>

    <h3>Differentiate between input, output, and storage. </h3>
    <p>IPO and IPOS. Input - raw data entered by a user or acquired from a data source. Process - transforms the data in a purposeful fashion into information. Output - provides the results of the transformation to the user. Storage - Components of the information system keep the input data, information, and results from various phases of the transformation for the intermediate or permanent record.</p>

        closed-source/proprietary - do not permit anyone to modify their operating system code. </p>
    <h3>Identify uses of patents and copyrights. </h3>
    <p>Legally protect a product from being copied by others. </p>
    <h3>Recognize software licensing agreements and why software should be properly licensed prior to installation. </h3>
    <p>Shareware is an application that can be installed as a trial limited by time and/or functionality. If the user decides to purchase the application or subscription, they then get the full functionality. 

        Freeware is, as the term suggests, free. However, freeware and shareware are both protected by end-user license agreements (EULA) and copyright laws (where applicable). 
        
        Public domain software has no EULA and no intellectual property protections and is available for anyone to download and use at their own discretion. </p>
    <h3>Recognize the purpose of end-user license agreements (EULA). </h3>
    <p>Define the acceptable usage/handling of a software package. </p>
    <h3>Differentiate between machine language and high-level languages. </h3>
    <p>Machine language is binary. High-level languages are human-readable. </p>
    <h3>Differentiate between compiled and interpreted languages. </h3>
    <p>A compiler checks source code for errors before translating it into object code. If the source code is found to have errors, the compiler specifies the errors. 

        Interpreters translate and execute source code into machine language one line at a time. If the interpreter finds an error, the process is terminated at the statement containing the error and displays an error message. </p>
    <h3>State the role of the compiler. </h3>
    <p>A compiler translates source code into machine language. An algorithm provides a specifically structured set of inputs (i.e., the steps of a recipe) required to produce a specific output (i.e., your cake, pie, cookies, or special entrée). </p>

    <h3>Define business intelligence. </h3>
    <p>The translation of raw data into something useful: knowledge.</p>
    <h3>Differentiate between different types of databases. </h3>
    <p>Flat-file - stores data in a plain text file. Traditional flat file systems are one-dimensional. Traditional files present information from a single point of view and do not interact with other files. 

        Relational - are multidimensional, allowing information to be accessed from various views through internal linking between entries. Each record has a unique identifier, such as a product identification number or username. This unique identifier, referred to as a primary key, creates the relationship among tables. A field may be marked as the primary key on one table but also be found on another table. When this happens, a relationship called a foreign key is created. 
        
        Hierarchical - one of the oldest database models. Data is organized in a tree structure, much like an organizational chart. There is one parent for each record, with optional nodes, forming sub-trees called segments. Access to the data is predictable and restricted to the paths in the trees. 
        
        object-oriented - object-oriented (OO) databases (also referred to as object databases) store complex data and relationships between data directly without using inter-table relations.  two components: data and instructions. The instructions, or software programs called methods, define what to do with the data in the object. 
        In key-value databases (also referred to as stores), each item in the database is stored as an attribute name (or key) together with its value. 

        Graph stores are used to store information about networks of data, such as social connections. 
        
        Wide-column stores are optimized for queries on large data sets and store columns of data together, instead of in rows. 
        
        Document-format databases pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document. Documents can contain many different key-value pairs. 
        
        NoSQL, which is short for not only SQL, databases can accommodate a wide variety of data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph formats. 
        Cloud databases are optimized to work in a cloud environment. Some practical benefits include the ability to increase resources to accommodate for demands on the system, to be highly available even in the case of local or regional outages, and to support SaaS (software as a service) cloud deployments. 

A data lake is a system of data stored in raw format. It is usually a single store of all enterprise data as well as information derived from data during reporting, transactions, or other activities. (structured and unstructured data).
    </p>
    <h3>Explain how data is organized in a database. </h3>
    <p>A database table is composed of records and fields that hold data. A database table, also known as a datasheet, is composed of records and fields that hold data. Data is stored in records. The columns represent fields. A field contains a single piece of data about the subject of a record. </p>
    <h3>Identify common database administration and maintenance tasks. </h3>
    <p>Data scientists analyze big data to decipher machine learning trends, so smart devices recognize speech or estimate travel times. 

        Data security professionals ensure data is safe and protected. 
        
        Network professionals move data form one device to another (storage device to a server). 
        
        Database administrators manage the access rights of users to various data resources. 
        
            Database security—ensuring that only authorized users have access to the database and fortifying it against unauthorized access. 
        
            Database tuning—optimizing performance of database systems. 
        
            High availability—making replicas (copies) of databases available from various locations; if one copy is unavailable due to outage, the alternate location can continue database services. 
        
            Business continuity—continuing core business operations effectively, even with the disruption of some auxiliary services. 
        
            Backup and recovery—planning for and executing adequate backup and recovery procedures. 
        
            Reporting—writing complex queries and generating reports for users. 
        
            Designing and developing database applications—writing code to interact with the database resources. </p>
    <h3>Explain the interaction of other applications with databases to create and retrieve data, including drivers. </h3>
    <p>A typical database application has two major layers: an application layer and a database management layer. The application layer communicates with the end user and can be fairly complex. After the application software receives a request from a user, it uses the database management system (DBMS) as a tool to obtain the results. The DBMS is similar to an operating system in that it supports the application software and the data. </p>
    <h3>Identify the relationships between applications and databases. </h3>
    <p>The database is a tool used to organize data in a way that it can be queried and analyzed. 

        Applications push and pull data into and from the database. </p>
    <h3>Identify basic structured query language (SQL) commands. </h3>
    <p>The DBMS complements the SQL code by providing a mechanism to send the code to and from the database server. 

        selection operation takes rows from one table and creates a new table. the asterisk (*) means everything from that table. 
        
        SELECT anything FROM Patient WHERE PatientID = ‘223344’.
        union operation combines distinct fields from multiple tables that have the same set of attributes and data types. 

        SELECT PatientID, LastName FROM Patient UNION SELECT NurseID, LastName FROM Nurse.
        product operation creates a result table that includes all of the attributes from the two tables; each row of the second table is added to each row of the first table. Notice when you are using more than one table as a source, the table name precedes the attribute name, separated by a period. 

        SELECT Shifts.WingSegment, Shifts.Shift, NurseName.LastName FROM Shifts CROSS JOIN NurseName. 
        join operation combines two tables, but records are only appended when a matching criterion is met. 

        implicit join. 
        
        SELECT anything FROM Patient, Nurse. 
        
        explicit join.

            functional managers, chief information officers (CIO), and chief information security officers (CISO) </p>
        <h3>Explain the importance of maintaining business and process continuity. </h3>
        <p>Smoothly operating IT systems will prevent employees from saving data to more convenient, yet unmonitored, platforms, which could lead to data leakage. 

            continuity plans help define how to resume services to customers and vital business operations, while auxiliary services may remain offline. 
            
            Disaster recovery plans (DRPs) rely on solutions to ensure that systems can recover from catastrophic events in a reasonable amount of time with minimal data loss. 
            
            Data mirroring, data backups, and off-site storage are some of the strategies used for disaster recovery and business continuity. 
            
            Hot storage allows organizations the quickest access to restore critical data in the event of a disaster or catastrophe. More expensive 
            
            Cold storage offers less frequent access and is maintained on minimal equipment that is considered lower performance.  less expensive. </p>
        <h3>Identify opportunities for buying versus building a solution in-house as well as insourcing versus outsourcing. </h3>
        <p>Hiring an organization that specializes in particular services is beneficial, as companies cannot always justify employing specialists with narrow skill sets. Outsourcing can improve efficiency and productivity, while also helping an organization save money. 

            Through an outsourcing arrangement, the service of an expert can be obtained in the absence of in-house expertise. 
            
            offshoring, outsourcing outside country lines.

        <h3>Describe user needs and other information systems requirements, including security and accessibility functions. </h3>
        <p>Requirements analysis requires significant input from stakeholders, such as potential users, as well as those with other ties, such as legal or financial interests. 

            Compiling and analyzing the needs of the system use. 
        
            Negotiating with project stakeholders on trade-offs between wants, needs, costs, and feasibility. 
        
            Developing a set of requirements identifying the necessary features and services of the completed system. 
        
        The system requirement specification (SRS) is a written agreement between all parties that records the system requirements and guides system development. </p>
        <h3>Describe the process of system deployment and integration with existing systems. </h3>
        <p>System documentation describes the system's internal configuration so the system can be maintained later in its life cycle. 

            Technical documentation describes how to install and maintain the system, including information about installing updates and providing feedback to the development team. </p>
        <h3>Identify the different types of testing. </h3>
        <p>Basis path testing develops a set of test data that ensures each instruction in the software is executed at least once. 

            Glass-box testing, commonly referred to as white-box testing, which includes having developers test internal structures of software.  
            
            Black-box testing does not rely on the tester's knowledge of the system's structure but is focused on the user experience (UX). 
            
            Alpha, beta, and acceptance (real-world use) testing. 
            
            The goal of corrective maintenance is to remove errors to ensure functionality of the system. 
            
            Adaptive maintenance is performed when organizational changes affect system requirements, such as changes in the organizational procedures, forms, or system controls and security needs. 
            
            Perfective maintenance is performed when new components are introduced, or existing components are improved, to enhance overall system performance. 
            
            Preventive maintenance refers to changes made to increase the life span of systems and could include restructuring, optimizing code, or updating documentation that impacts the scalability, stability, and maintainability of the system. </p>
        <h3>Define project initiation, risk and business impact analysis, risk mitigation, and control. </h3>
        <p>Risks in execution, risks in integration, and risks of the unknown are three broad categories of risks a project may encounter. 

            Risks in execution typically revolve around budget, people, technology, equipment, and stakeholder support. 
            
            Risks of integration involve the outcome of a project, which will likely affect other systems and processes in an organization. 
            
                Scope creep—uncontrolled change of a project’s scope, typically adding tasks and increased, unplanned costs to the project. 
            
                Budget risk—budget control issues, such as underestimated or improper allocation of cost. 
            
                Resistance to change—departments and individuals resist organizational changes resulting from the project. 
            
                Resource risk—inability to secure sufficient resources for the project. 
            
                Contract risk—a vendor fails to deliver on contractual obligations. 
            
                Disputes or disagreements between project participants. 
            
                Project dependencies—especially when completion of some tasks is dependent on the completion of other tasks. 
            
                Project assumptions risk—when assumptions about the project are invalidated during project development. 
            
                Benefit shortfall—the project meets the requirements but delivers fewer benefits than outlined in the business case. 
            
                Requirements quality risk—requirements have not been properly validated or documented. 
            
                Force majeure risk—the chance of a major negative event beyond human control, such as a natural disaster. </p>
        <h3>Describe the characteristics of a project and identify its phases. </h3>
        <p>1. Project initiation broadly defines the project. It usually begins with a business case, followed by a feasibility study. 

 

            2. Project planning includes developing a road map that everyone follows. 
            
            SMART framework. 
            
            Specific, Set a specific goal that answers the questions who, what, where, when, which, and why. 
            
            Measurable, Create criteria that can be used to measure the success of the goal. 
            
            Attainable, Ensure the goal is attainable given the resources. 
            
            Realistic, Assess the willingness to work toward the goal. 
            
            Timely, The goal should be achievable within the available timeframe. 
            
            CLEAR framework. 
            
            Collaborative, The goal should encourage employees to work together. 
            
            Limited, The goal should be limited in scope and time to keep it manageable. 
            
            Emotional, The goal should tap into the passion of employees and be something they can form an emotional connection to. This can optimize the quality of work. 
            
            Appreciable, Break larger goals into smaller tasks that can be quickly achieved. 
            
            Refinable, As new situations arise, be flexible and refine the goal as needed. 
            
            Scope statement, work breakdown structure (WBS), milestones, communication plan, risk management plan. 
            
             
            
            3. During project execution, project deliverables are developed and completed. A kickoff meeting usually marks the start of this phase. 
            
             
            
            4. At the project closure phase, the project is declared complete and the project team is dissolved. Project managers complete the final project documentation, including financial reports. 
            
             
            
            Software Development Life Cycle:  Planning, design, implementation, testing deployment, maintenance. </p>
